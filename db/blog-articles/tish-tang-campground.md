What a lovely stay. 
Nestled in the Hoopa valley this campground is run by Intar, a local. 
The campground was luxurious - water, trash, toilets.  

From the toilets, you can take a short walk down an old creek bed trail and find yourself at a fork. Right takes you to the beach, rocky and full of life. Left takes you down the secret trail to beutiful private views, rock bluffs, andswimming wholes (also full of life).
When you get to the beach, it is a very narrow point on the river where you can almost get to the other side. Don't try though, the river is swift. There was a big fish net stretched into the river, utalizing the natural whirlpool caused by the bend to stay seated in the middle of the river. We waded in and saw all sorts of fish including cray fish as they defended their rocky homes from us, the giant invaders.

There is also public access to the beach by car for day use.

The camp was still and quiet during the week, and Inkar stopped by and chatted with us a couple times during the trip. He also gave us a book to learn about the Reservation we were on and some other great spots nearby. 
Stars were gorgeous. 
Starlink also worked well because we had a large clearing in the back of our camp. 

Would Stay Again.
